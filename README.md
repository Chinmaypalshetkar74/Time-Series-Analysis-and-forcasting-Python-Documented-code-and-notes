TimeSeries-Analysis-Forecasting
This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for mastering time series analysis and forecasting using Python, tailored for data science enthusiasts and aspiring analysts. It combines detailed study notes, fully documented code snippets, and hands-on Jupyter notebooks to guide learners from fundamentals to advanced techniques.

Key Features
Core Concepts: In-depth notes on time series components (trend, seasonality, cyclicity, irregularity), stationarity tests (ADF, KPSS), decomposition methods, and autocorrelation analysis (ACF/PACF).

Hands-On Code: Practical implementations with Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, Scikit-learn, Prophet, and TensorFlow/Keras for:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualization, resampling, lag features.

Classical Models: ARIMA/SARIMA, Exponential Smoothing.

ML/DL Models: LSTM, GRU, Prophet for univariate/multivariate forecasting.

Capstone Project: Real-world crypto and altcoin time series analysis & forecasting. Analyzes historical price data (BTC, ETH, altcoins) from sources like Yahoo Finance/CCXT. Features include:

Data ingestion, cleaning, feature engineering (volatility, RSI, moving averages).

Model comparison: ARIMA vs. LSTM vs. Prophet on crypto volatility.

Evaluation metrics: MAE, RMSE, MAPE; backtesting with walk-forward validation.

Interactive dashboards via Plotly for price trends, residuals, and prediction intervals.
